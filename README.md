# pycaz - a package for doing work!

`pycaz`, a play on sounds on package, is a python package gathering the analysis tools developed during modelling with
SCHISM, but now expanded to contains all sorts of analysis and modelling functionalities. The original package was
called (vary unoriginally) pyschism. However, following the development of the toolbox by the SCHISM/NOAA
called [pyschism](https://github.com/schism-dev/pyschism), the name is released for their use and `pycaz` was born.

The name `pycaz` comes from combination of `py` (obviously short form of python) and `caz` (from Bengali word "কাজ",
which means work). It is also intended as a pun since `pycaz` can also be read like 'package' (an overarching package to
collect processing, analysis, tools).

Being a collection of different types of analysis, pre- and post-processing methods, some modules follows a more
object-oriented pattern, and some follows a more functional/procedural pattern. The documentation of the modules are not
yet well-developed, and will be incorporated in a best-effort basis.

# Installation

For best experience, the package should be installed in a conda environment, which can be obtained through any conda
distribution such as [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
or [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/). For a lighter installation use miniconda.

```shell
conda create -n pycaz \
            -c conda-forge \
            python=3.12 \
            numpy scipy matplotlib \
            pandas openpyxl xlrd \
            xarray[complete] netcdf4 \
            cmocean rioxarray \
            utide \
            tqdm ipykernel \
            pyproj cartopy geopandas shapely \
            beautifulsoup4 lxml fastkml \
            jupyterlab jupyter notebook ipywidgets jupyter_contrib_nbextensions \
            hydromt hydromt_sfincs \
            wavespectra
```

Then the toolbox can be installed using -

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jamal919/pycaz
cd pycaz
conda activate pycaz
pip install -e . # soft install allows for development too
```

If you do not want to install the toolbox, or want to use it in a development mode then do the following the in the
beginning of your python script/notebook -

```python
import sys

sys.path.append('/path/to/pycaz')  # the outer directory downloaded from git

# now the modules/functions can be loaded as necessary
from pycaz.cyclone.jtwc import read_jtwc
```
