`pycaz`, a play on sounds on package, is a python package gathering the analysis tools 
developed during modelling with SCHISM, but now expanded to contains all sorts of analysis 
and modelling functionalities. The original package was called (vary unoriginally) pyschism.
However following the development of the toolbox by the SCHISM/NOAA called pyschism, the
name is released for their use. The name `pycaz` comes from combination of py (short of python)
and caz (from Bengali word "কাজ", which means work).

.. danger::
    This toolbox is still in its major version 0. The interface might change during its 
    development, caution is adviced. Please direct your advice, contribution, 
    bug reports to the [github repository](https://github.com/jamal919/pycaz)
